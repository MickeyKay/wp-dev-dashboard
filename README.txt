Easily view all of your unresolved plugin & theme support tickets.

== Description ==

**Like this plugin? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/wp-dev-dashboard).**

WP Dev Dashboard allows you to easily view and respond to all of your unresolved plugin & theme support requests. The default wordpress.org support forums can be difficult to parse, particularly if you have authored numerous plugins and/or themes that generate a large number of support requests. This plugin allows you to easily view and respond to your unresolved plugin and theme support requests in a simple, easy-to-use interface.

= Features =
* Displays plugin and theme support requests in sortable, collapsible metaboxes for ease of use.
* View plugins and themes by user and/or slug.
* Choose whether to show all support tickets, or just unresolved ones.
* Implements caching to reduce load time for plugin and theme support ticket information.
* Includes cache-busting "refresh" option to force refresh plugin and theme support ticket data.

= Coming soon. . . =
WP Dev Dashboard is intended to be the go-to resource for WordPress plugin and theme authors looking for a better management experience.

If you have an idea for a feature you'd like to see, please submit it via the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-dev-dashboard).
