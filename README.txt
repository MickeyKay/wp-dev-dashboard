The better tool for monitoring your plugins & themes, including support requests, download stats, version support, and more.

== Description ==

**Like this plugin? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/wp-dev-dashboard).**

WP Dev Dashboard takes improves upon the default plugin/theme interfaces for authors, and allows you to easily:

1. View and respond to all of your unresolved plugin & theme support requests.
2. View useful statistics for all of your plugins & themes.

The default wordpress.org plugin/theme author dashboards can be difficult to parse, particularly if you have authored numerous plugins and/or themes that generate a large number of support requests. This plugin allows you to easily view and respond to your unresolved plugin and theme support requests in a simple, easy-to-use interface. Additionally, you can view *all* of your plugin/theme statistics (version, WP compatibility, downloads, ratings, etc) in a sortable table that makes side-by-side comparison a cinch.

= Features =
* Displays plugin and theme support requests in sortable, collapsible metaboxes for ease of use.
* Displays all plugins and themes in a sortable, easy-to-parse table.
* Select which plugins and themes to show by username and/or slug.
* Choose whether to show all support tickets, or just unresolved ones.
* Implements caching to reduce load time for plugin and theme support ticket information.
* Includes cache-busting "refresh" option to force refresh plugin and theme support ticket data.

= Coming soon. . . =
